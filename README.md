# 🎮 IOTGamified 3.0 – Build Your Own IoT Game Controller!
Welcome to IOTGamified 3.0, hosted by the IOTHINC Club of VIT Vellore! 🚀
In this two-day hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to design and build your very own IoT-powered game controller using ESP modules and a Python-based UDP communication system. 
Get ready to explore IoT, microcontrollers, sensors, and networking – and walk away with a fully functional DIY game controller! 🌟

📚 Workshop Roadmap
Here’s what we’ll cover:
Introduction to IoT → What IoT is, its real-world applications, and future opportunities. 🌐
Microcontrollers Deep Dive → ESP32 vs Arduino: features, differences, and when to use which.
Basic Sensors & Actuators → Hands-on with temperature sensors, buzzers, and how to integrate them.
Virtual Circuits on Wokwi → Build and test circuits online before hardware deployment. 👾
Networking Protocols → Learn about UDP (core focus), with an overview of TCP.
Arduino IDE Setup → Installing and programming ESP modules using Arduino IDE.
Multiplexers (MUX) → Crash course on how MUX works and its use in hardware projects.
Networking Basics → Ports, IP addresses, sockets, and how devices talk to each other. 🌍

💻 Installation & Setup Guide
To ensure a smooth workshop experience, please install the following tools before Day 1.

✅ 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Your main editor for ESP and Python scripts.
🔗 Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Steps:
Choose your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Run the installer and follow on-screen steps.
Open VS Code to confirm installation.
✅ 2. Install Python 3
Required for UDP communication and game controller simulation.
🔗 Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Steps:
Download the latest stable Python 3.x version.
During installation:
✅ Check “Add Python to PATH”.
Verify installation:
python --version
✅ 3. Install Arduino IDE
Used to program the ESP module.
🔗 Download: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Steps:
Download installer for your OS.
Run setup and complete installation.
Open Arduino IDE to verify it launches.
✅ 4. Install Required Python Libraries
Open Command Prompt / Terminal and run:
For game controller simulation (vgamepad):
pip install vgamepad
For networking (socket – already built into Python, but just in case):
pip install sockets
Verify with:
python -m pip show vgamepad

🎉 You’re All Set!
By the end of setup, you should have:
✔️ VS Code installed
✔️ Python installed and working
✔️ Arduino IDE installed
✔️ vgamepad & socket libraries ready

Now you’re ready to dive in and start coding your IoT game controller! 🎮

🚀 Final Note
Come to the workshop with curiosity, creativity, and energy. By the end, you’ll not only understand IoT fundamentals but also walk away with a custom-built game controller powered by your ESP module.
We can’t wait to see your innovative builds at IOTGamified 3.0! 🌟
